## Repository Guide

- `/exercises`: Various individual programming exercises taken from various sources.
    - Exercises are numbered in chronological order.
    - Exercises are also marked with a difficulty level:
        - `B` = Beginner, `I` = Intermediate, `A` = Advanced.
    - The sources of these exercises (e.g. *Cracking the Coding Interview*, *Google Tech Dev Guide*, *CS50x*, etc.) should hopefully be marked in some way. An index of these sources is in `/exercises/README.md`.
- `/golf`: Various code golf solutions I've made. (I don't really code golf much though...)
